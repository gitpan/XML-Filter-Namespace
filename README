XML::Filter::Namespace version 1.00
===================================

This module is a simple SAX filter to get rid of all but a single namespace
from a piece of XML.  It is useful when you have multiple namespaces inside a
file and want a clearer view of one of them.

It includes a command line tool (filtns) to perform this task easily.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    Class::Accessor
    Test::More
    XML::SAX
    XML::SAX::Writer

Two of those are only for running the test suite, but they're probably useful
anyway.
